This multidisciplinary network of ~2,800 researchers in the fields of animal cognition and communication, neuroscience, anthropology, AI and computer sciences, philosophers, artists, and musicians hosts an annual conference, monthly lectures, and workshops where speakers present their current research and ideas about interspecies communication and approaches to deciphering the signals of non-human animals. It was founded by Peter Gabriel (musician and activist), Dr. Vint Cerf (Vice President at Google and Co-designer of the Internet), Dr. Diana Reiss (Professor at Hunter College, a cognitive psychologist, and marine mammal scientist), and Dr. Neil Gershenfeld (head of MITâ€™s Center for Bits and Atoms) to inspire and encourage new collaborative efforts and strengthen existing partnerships in these important areas of research.
