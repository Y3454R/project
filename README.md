# Earth Species Project

wip

The Earth Species Project is an open-source collaborative and nonprofit dedicated to decoding animal communication.

We are inspired by the incredible diversity of communication systems on Earth. From the mycelial networks that connect Earthâ€™s forests like an Internet to the rainbow-rave richness of cuttlefish communication, we are surrounded by messages and meaning. We believe that an understanding of non-human languages will change our ecological impact on this planet.

We are motivated by the recent monumental milestone in machine learning: the invention of techniques that can translate languages without dictionaries.

The [earthspecies.org](https://earthspecies.org) website contains an overview of the project. If you are a biologist or ML practitioner, the [library](https://github.com/earthspecies/library) and [roadmap](/roadmap) are great places to start.
